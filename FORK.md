### DL001 — Fix Claude Code authentication and session startup on Windows

Claude Code installed through npm exposes a Windows command shim such as `claude.cmd`, while `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` expects a direct native executable path. This caused both provider authentication checks and turn startup to fail with a native-binary error.

The fork patches `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk@0.3.170` to use its bundled native Windows `claude.exe` when the configured executable is a non-native command path. Explicit native `.exe` paths remain supported.

The desktop artifact builder also pins patched dependencies to the exact versions named by their patch entries when creating the lockfile-free staged production workspace. Without this, the SDK caret range can resolve a newer release and pnpm fails with `ERR_PNPM_UNUSED_PATCH` before packaging.

**Files modified:**

- `patches/@anthropic-ai__claude-agent-sdk@0.3.170.patch`
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- `apps/server/src/provider/Layers/ProviderRegistry.test.ts`
- `scripts/build-desktop-artifact.ts`
- `scripts/build-desktop-artifact.test.ts`

**Validation:**

- Claude SDK initialization smoke test succeeds on Windows.
- Claude adapter tests pass.
- `vp check` passes with no errors.
- `vp run typecheck` passes.
- Server build passes.
- Windows x64 NSIS packaging passes and bundles Claude Code native binaries.
